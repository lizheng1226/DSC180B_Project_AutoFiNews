0,0,Apple Sues NSO Group to Curb the Abuse of State-Sponsored Spyware.txt,"apple also announced a $10 million contribution to support cybersurveillance researchers and advocatescupertino, calif., november 23, 2021--(business wire)--apple® today filed a lawsuit against nso group and its parent company to hold it accountable for the surveillance and targeting of apple users. the complaint provides new information on how nso group infected victims’ devices with its pegasus spyware. to prevent further abuse and harm to its users, apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban nso group from using any apple software, services, or devices.nso group creates sophisticated, state-sponsored surveillance technology that allows its highly targeted spyware to surveil its victims. these attacks are only aimed at a very small number of users, and they impact people across multiple platforms, including ios and android. researchers and journalists have publicly documented a history of this spyware being abused to target journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials.1""state-sponsored actors like the nso group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. that needs to change,"" said craig federighi, apple’s senior vice president of software engineering. ""apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous. while these cybersecurity threats only impact a very small number of our customers, we take any attack on our users very seriously, and we’re constantly working to strengthen the security and privacy protections in ios to keep all our users safe.""nso group’s forcedentry eploitapple’s legal complaint provides new information on nso group’s forcedentry, an eploit for a now-patched vulnerability previously used to break into a victim’s apple device and install the latest version of nso group’s spyware product, pegasus. the eploit was originally identified by the citizen lab, a research group at the university of toronto.story continuesthe spyware was used to attack a small number of apple users worldwide with dangerous malware and spyware. apple’s lawsuit seeks to ban nso group from further harming individuals by using apple’s products and services. the lawsuit also seeks redress for nso group’s flagrant violations of us federal and state law, arising out of its efforts to target and attack apple and its users.nso group and its clients devote the immense resources and capabilities of nation-states to conduct highly targeted cyberattacks, allowing them to access the microphone, camera, and other sensitive data on apple and android devices. to deliver forcedentry to apple devices, attackers created apple ids to send malicious data to a victim’s device — allowing nso group or its clients to deliver and install pegasus spyware without a victim’s knowledge. though misused to deliver forcedentry, apple servers were not hacked or compromised in the attacks.apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market, and constantly invests in strengthening privacy and security protections for its users. for eample, researchers have found that other mobile platforms have 15 times more malware infections than iphone®,2 and a recent study showed that less than 2 percent of mobile malware targets ios devices.3ios 15 includes a number of new security protections, including significant upgrades to the blastdoor security mechanism. while nso group spyware continues to evolve, apple has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running ios 15 and later versions. apple urges all users to update their iphone and always use the latest software.""at apple, we are always working to defend our users against even the most comple cyberattacks. the steps we’re taking today will send a clear message: in a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,"" said ivan krstić, head of apple security engineering and architecture. ""our threat intelligence and engineering teams work around the clock to analyze new threats, rapidly patch vulnerabilities, and develop industry-leading new protections in our software and silicon. apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like nso group.""apple’s continuing efforts to protect its usersapple commends groups like the citizen lab and amnesty tech for their groundbreaking work to identify cybersurveillance abuses and help protect victims. to further strengthen efforts like these, apple will be contributing $10 million, as well as any damages from the lawsuit, to organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.apple will also support the accomplished researchers at the citizen lab with pro-bono technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance to aid their independent research mission, and where appropriate, will offer the same assistance to other organizations doing critical work in this space.""mercenary spyware firms like nso group have facilitated some of the world’s worst human rights abuses and acts of transnational repression, while enriching themselves and their investors,"" said ron deibert, director of the citizen lab at the university of toronto. ""i applaud apple for holding them accountable for their abuses, and hope in doing so apple will help to bring justice to all who have been victimized by nso group’s reckless behavior.""apple is notifying the small number of users that it discovered may have been targeted by forcedentry. any time apple discovers activity consistent with a state-sponsored spyware attack, apple will notify the affected users in accordance with industry best practices.apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right, and security is a constant focus for teams across the company. for years, apple has led the industry with new protections to disrupt sophisticated attacks and defend its users, including features such as pointer authentication codes (pac), blastdoor, and the page protection layer (ppl). for more information about apple’s platform security, visit support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web.1 citizen lab, ""nso group imessage zero-click eploit captured in the wild,"" sept. 13, 2021.2 nokia, ""threat intelligence report 2020,"" 2020.3 purplesec, ""2021 cyber security statistics: the ultimate list of stats, data & trends,"" 2021.apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the macintosh in 1984. today, apple leads the world in innovation with iphone, ipad, mac, apple watch, and apple tv. apple’s five software platforms — ios, ipados, macos, watchos, and tvos — provide seamless eperiences across all apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the app store, apple music, apple pay, and icloud. apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.note to editors: for additional information visit apple newsroom (www.apple.com/newsroom), or call apple’s media helpline at (408) 974-2042.© 2021 apple inc. all rights reserved. apple, the apple logo, and iphone are trademarks of apple. other company and product names may be trademarks of their respective owners.view source version on businesswire.com: <url> contacts:scott radcliffeapplesradcliffe@apple.com fred sainzapplesainz@apple.com",2021-11-23,0,161.41000366210938,161.14000244140624,0,163.2570007324219,1,168.66947374845805,1,168.66947374845805,1

15,18,"Apple Advances Its Privacy Leadership with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8.txt","new features help users control and monitor apps’ use of their dataapple® today previewed powerful new privacy protections in ios 15, ipados® 15, macos® monterey, and watchos® 8, which help users better control and manage access to their data. these features represent the latest innovations in apple’s legacy of privacy leadership, as the company has continually epanded its commitment to privacy and encouraged change across the industry with features like app tracking transparency and privacy nutrition labels on the app store®.this press release features multimedia. view the full release here: <url> privacy report shows you all the cross-site trackers that are being blocked by intelligent tracking prevention in safari. (photo: business wire)""privacy has been central to our work at apple from the very beginning,"" said craig federighi, apple’s senior vice president of software engineering. ""every year, we push ourselves to develop new technology to help users take more control of their data and make informed decisions about whom they share it with. this year’s updates include innovative features that give users deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.""protect data from third partiesin the mail app, mail privacy protection stops senders from using invisible piels to collect information about the user. the new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their ip address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.for a number of years, intelligent tracking prevention has helped protect safari® users from unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers while allowing websites to function normally. this year, intelligent tracking prevention is getting even stronger by also hiding the user’s ip address from trackers. this means they can’t utilize the user’s ip address as a unique identifier to connect their activity across websites and build a profile about them.story continuescheck up on app privacywith app privacy report, users can see how often each app has used the permission they’ve previously granted to access their location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts during the past seven days.1 users can check whether this makes sense to them, and take action by going to the app in settings if it doesn’t. users can also find out with whom their data may be shared by seeing all the third-party domains an app is contacting.process audio of siri requests on devicewith on-device speech recognition, the audio of users’ requests is processed right on their iphone® or ipad® by default. this addresses one of the biggest privacy concerns for voice assistants, which is unwanted audio recording. for many requests, siri® processing is also moving on device, enabling requests to be processed without an internet connection, such as launching apps, setting timers and alarms, changing settings, or controlling music.enhance internet privacy with icloud+icloud+℠ combines everything customers love about icloud® with new premium features, including icloud private relay, hide my email, and epanded homekit® secure video support, at no additional cost.2private relay is a new internet privacy service that’s built right into icloud, allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. when browsing with safari, private relay ensures all traffic leaving a user’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even apple or the user’s network provider. all the user’s requests are then sent through two separate internet relays. the first assigns the user an anonymous ip address that maps to their region but not their actual location. the second decrypts the web address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. this separation of information protects the user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit.epanding on the capabilities of sign in with apple, hide my email lets users share unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbo anytime they wish to keep their personal email address private. built directly into safari, icloud settings, and mail, hide my email also enables users to create and delete as many addresses as needed at any time, helping give users control of who is able to contact them.3icloud+ epands built-in support for homekit secure video, so users can connect more cameras than ever before in the home app, while giving them end-to-end encrypted storage for home security video footage that will not count against their storage capacity. homekit secure video also ensures that activity detected by users’ security cameras is analyzed and encrypted by their apple devices at home before being securely stored in icloud.additional features for users and developersthese releases also feature powerful new tools that help developers enhance app functionality while preserving user privacy.with share current location, users can easily share their current location with an app just once, without giving the developer further access after that session. developers can customize the share current location button, and integrate it directly into their apps.with enhanced photos limited library access, developers can offer smart functionality — like a recent photos folder for specific albums — even when a user has only granted limited access.with secure paste, developers can let users paste from a different app without having access to what was copied until the user takes action to paste it into their app. when developers use secure paste, users will be able to paste without being alerted via the pasteboard transparency notification, helping give them peace of mind.footnotes1 app privacy
