VALUATION
    O  n a split-adjusted basis, AAPL trades at 25.4-times our FY21
EPS forecast and at 23.6-times our FY22 forecast; the two-year
average P/E of 24.5 remains well above the five-year (FY16-FY20)
trailing  multiple  of  15.8.  Apple  is  trading  at  a  premium  to
historical relative multiples. Over the past five years, AAPL has
traded at an average 17% discount to the market multiple, or at a
relative P/E of 0.83. The stock now trades at 101% of the market
multiple on a two-year-average forward basis, or at a relative P/E
of 1.01. On all comparable historicals, we calculate a split-adjusted
value in the mid-$80s, in a stable trend though below current
prices.
   A A PL trades at premiums to the technology hardware peer
group on P/E, relative P/E, EV/EBITDA and PEGY. While peer
indicated value of about $100 is below current prices, we believe
that  AAPL  warrants  a  significant  premium  to  peers  given  the
company's  ability  to  expand  globally  and  to  generate  healthy
demand for its products in every kind of economy. Apple also
trades on GAAP results while peers trade on non-GAAP results.
     Our more forward-looking two- and three-stage discounted free
cash flow model renders a value around $250 per share, in a rising
trend and well above current levels. Our blended fundamental
valuation model points to a price above $220, in a rising trend and
well above current prices.
     A p preciation  to  our  split-adjusted  12-month  target  price  of
$165, along with the dividend yield of about 0.6%, implies a
risk-adjusted total return in excess of our forecast for the broad
market and is thus consistent with a BUY rating.
     On October 18, BUY-rated AAPL closed at $146.55, up $1.71.
