are ready.
   A p ple sells phones around the globe; smartphones are now
ubiquitous and in need of constant upgrades; and consumers are
anxious to remain within the Apple ecosystem. For these reasons,
we expect Apple's long-cycle demand to smooth any near-term
demand bumps. Tariffs also represent a difficult-to-quantify risk,
but all parties have a long-term interest in facilitating global trade
flows.
   I n vestors have criticized Apple for its closed ecosystem. That
system, however, has the effect of prompting consumers to buy
iPads and Macs for system compatibility. Even more compelling for
brand loyalty are Apple's services, including iTunes, App Store,
and iCloud, as consumers do not want the cost and complexity of
pulling their media libraries out of the comfortable arms of Mother
Apple.
    T he shares are always at risk from the perception that growth
could slow as the law of large numbers catches up with Apple. The
company has mitigated that risk, in our view, with very aggressive
shareholder return policies, which will likely remain paramount.
Despite the company's growing largesse, we expect institutional
investors to continue to demand more aggressive dividend growth
and a larger share repurchase plan.

    O  n a split adjusted basis, AAPL trades at 24.6-times our FY21
EPS forecast and at 23.0-times our FY22 forecast; the two-year
average P/E of 23.8 remains well above the five-year (FY16-FY20)
trailing  multiple  of  15.8.  Apple  is  trading  at  a  premium  to
historical relative multiples. Over the past five years, AAPL has
traded at an average 17% discount to the market multiple, or at a

multiple on a two-year-average forward basis, or at a relative P/E
of 1.02. On all comparable historicals, we calculate a split-adjusted
