VALUATION
    O  n a split adjusted basis, AAPL trades at 27.9-times our FY21
EPS forecast and at 25.7-times our FY22 forecast; the two-year
average  P/E  of  26.8  is  now  above  the  five-year  (FY16-FY20)
trailing  multiple  of  15.8.  Apple  is  trading  at  a  premium  to
historical relative multiples. Over the past five years, AAPL has
traded at an average 18% discount to the market multiple, or at a
relative P/E of 0.82. The stock now trades at 136% of the market
multiple on a two-year-average forward basis, or at a relative P/E
of 1.36. On all comparable historicals, we calculate a split-adjusted
value in the low- to mid-$60s, in a rising trend though below
current prices.
   A A PL trades at premiums to the technology hardware peer
group on P/E, relative P/E, EV/EBITDA and PEGY. While peer
indicated value is below current prices, we believe  that AAPL
warrants a significant premium to peers given the company's ability
to expand globally and to generate healthy demand for its products
in every kind of economy. Apple also trades on GAAP results while
peers trade on non-GAAP results.
     Our more forward-looking two- and three-stage discounted free
cash flow model renders a value north of $185 per share, in a clear
rising  trend  and  well  above  current  levels.  Our  blended
fundamental valuation model points to a price around $165, well
above current prices.
     A p preciation  to  our  split-adjusted  12-month  target  price  of
$150, along with the dividend yield of about 0.7%, implies a
risk-adjusted total return in excess of our forecast for the broad
market and is thus consistent with a BUY rating.
     On October 30 at midday, BUY-rated AAPL traded at $108.80,
down $6.52.
