VALUATION
     A A PL  trades  at  24.3-times  our  FY22  EPS  forecast  and  at
22.4-times our FY23 forecast; the two-year average P/E of 23.3
remains well above the five-year (FY17-FY21) trailing multiple of
18.0. Apple is trading at a premium to historical relative multiples.
Over the past five years, AAPL has traded at an average 12%
discount to the market multiple, or at a relative P/E of 0.88. The
stock  now  trades  at  111%  of  the  market  multiple  on  a
two-year-average forward basis, or at a relative P/E of 1.11. On all
comparable historicals, we calculate a split-adjusted value in the
low-$100s, in a clear rising trend though below current prices.
   A A PL trades at premiums to the technology hardware peer
group on P/E, relative P/E, EV/EBITDA and PEGY. While peer
indicated value of about $100 is below current prices, we believe
that  AAPL  warrants  a  significant  premium  to  peers  given  the
company's  ability  to  expand  globally  and  to  generate  healthy
demand for its products in every kind of economy. Apple also
trades on GAAP results while peers trade on non-GAAP results.
     Our more forward-looking two- and three-stage discounted free
cash flow model renders a value around $280 per share, in a rising
trend and well above current levels. Our blended fundamental
valuation model points to a price above $245, in a rising trend and
well above current prices.
     A p preciation  to  our  split-adjusted  12-month  target  price  of
$180 (raised from $165), along with the dividend yield of about
0.5%, implies a risk-adjusted total return in excess of our forecast
for the broad market and is thus consistent with a BUY rating.
     On October 28, BUY-rated AAPL closed at $152.57, up $3.72.
