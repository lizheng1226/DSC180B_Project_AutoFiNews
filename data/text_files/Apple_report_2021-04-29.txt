   A p ple sells phones around the globe; smartphones are now
ubiquitous and in need of constant upgrades; and consumers are
anxious to remain within the Apple ecosystem. For these reasons,
we expect Apple's long-cycle demand to smooth any near-term
demand bumps. Tariffs also represent a difficult-to-quantify risk,
but all parties have a long-term interest in facilitating global trade
flows.
   I n vestors have criticized Apple for its closed ecosystem. That
system, however, has the effect of prompting consumers to buy
iPads and Macs for system compatibility. Even more compelling for
brand loyalty are Apple's services, including iTunes, App Store,
and iCloud, as consumers do not want the cost and complexity of
pulling their media libraries out of the comfortable arms of Mother
Apple.
    T he shares are always at risk from the perception that growth
could slow as the law of large numbers catches up with Apple. The
company has mitigated that risk, in our view, with very aggressive
shareholder return policies, which will likely remain paramount.
Despite the company's growing largesse, we expect institutional
investors to continue to demand more aggressive dividend growth
and a larger share repurchase plan.
COMPANY DESCRIPTION
   A p ple manufactures smartphones, tablets, PCs, software and
peripherals for a worldwide customer base. Its products include
Mac desktop and mobile PCs, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and
various consumer products, including AirPods, Beats headphones
and Apple TV. Apple services include App Store, iTunes, iCloud,
Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and more.
VALUATION
    O  n a split adjusted basis, AAPL trades at 26.6-times our FY21
EPS forecast and at 24.5-times our FY22 forecast; the two-year
average P/E of 25.5 remains well above the five-year (FY16-FY20)
trailing  multiple  of  15.8.  Apple  is  trading  at  a  premium  to
historical relative multiples. Over the past five years, AAPL has
traded at an average 17% discount to the market multiple, or at a
relative P/E of 0.83. The stock now trades at 110% of the market
multiple on a two-year-average forward basis, or at a relative P/E
of 1.10. On all comparable historicals, we calculate a split-adjusted
value in the mid-$70s, in a clearly rising trend though below
current prices.
   A A PL trades at premiums to the technology hardware peer
group on P/E, relative P/E, EV/EBITDA and PEGY. While peer
indicated value of about $100 is below current prices, we believe
that  AAPL  warrants  a  significant  premium  to  peers  given  the
company's  ability  to  expand  globally  and  to  generate  healthy
demand for its products in every kind of economy. Apple also
trades on GAAP results while peers trade on non-GAAP results.
     Our more forward-looking two- and three-stage discounted free
cash flow model renders a value north of $225 per share, in a clear
rising  trend  and  well  above  current  levels.  Our  blended
fundamental valuation model points to a price of $195, also well
above current prices.
